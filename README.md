# MurderMystery
Use clues to query information that helps deduce which person is the murderer and which is the victim

Start by using the "menu." query to see a list of clues that can be used.

Once you have decided who you think the killer and victim are, enter the "solution." query.

# NOTES:
- Clues can be entered as "clue_A(K,V)" to list all of the pairings or as "clue_A(betty, edwin)." to see if the relationship is true or false.

- All queries must end with a period and names must be completely lowercase.
